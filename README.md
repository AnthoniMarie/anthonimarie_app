    My application allows you to consult my blog from your mobile and receive a notification when a new article is published!  </p>
</p>


- **Language:** Typescript

# Goal of the project

> At EPITECH, we have a HUB module which is used to train us and discover new technologies. So I decided to discover  Typescript and to deepen my learning of React Native by making a small application which makes available my blog currently available via anthoni-marie.fr/blog, on mobile! The + is that when I publish an article on my site, a push notification is automatically sent to the application ;)

> :exclamation: This app has not been published on the App Store and Play store
